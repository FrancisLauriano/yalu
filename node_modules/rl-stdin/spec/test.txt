PORTIA: A pound of this merchant’s flesh is yours. The court awards it and the law authorizes it.

SHYLOCK: What a righteous judge!

PORTIA: And you have to cut this flesh from his chest. The law allows it, and the court awards it.

SHYLOCK: What a wise judge! Come on, get ready.

PORTIA: But wait a moment. There’s something else. This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all. The words expressly specify “a pound of flesh.” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh, but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it, the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law.
